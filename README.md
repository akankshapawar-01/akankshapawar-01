### 🚀 About Me

I'm a Computer Engineering graduate (2023) on a mission to grow, one line of code at a time.  
After a detour from tech, I'm back — stronger, more focused, and consistently upskilling.

- 🌱 Currently learning: **Java**, **Spring**, **SQL**, **DSA**
- 🔁 Ongoing Project: `30 Days of SQL` – practicing every day & documenting everything.
- 📂 Check out my learning folders & follow along. You’ll see the real progress — with ups and downs.
- 📍 Based in Pune, exploring job opportunities in tech — startups or MNCs.
